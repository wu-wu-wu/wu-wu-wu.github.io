              <!--p>I'm passionate about creating systems that help people succeed in each daily interaction big or small. My decisions are made people-first and informed by data. I aim to deliver joy and empowerment to the multitude of human experiences through digital products, art and furniture.</p-->
              <p>Suzanne grew up travelling between the rural expanses of Chinese countryside, the tight quarters of Shanghai city and US surburbia. The scenery changed but she kept drawing. When she got accepted into the <a href="http://risd.edu/">Rhode Island School of Design</a> she didn't know where her love and ability for drawing was going to take her. Eager to try outside her comfort zone, she declared her major in the <a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/">Furniture Design Department</a> - a mixture of creative expression and practical problem-solving. Within the discipline she discovered her idealism for chansing after moments of charm and meaningful difference in people's everyday lives through design, and this outcome was way better than she could have ever predicted.</p>

              <p>Since graduating, she has worked on her craft creating marketing collaterals for various clients like <a href="http://www.innovex.co/">INNOVEX</a>, <a href="http://pneuha.us/">Pneuhaus</a>, and more. She also got a taste of the publishing world by developing and consuming ebooks at the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</a>.</p>

              <p>Suzanne recently had the privilege to work with the <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/">Fresh Tilled Soil</a> team as a part of their User Experience Apprenticeship program. The immersion included her running her first design sprint, testing and interviewing on actual users, and strategizing business goals with user goals and presenting to clients. <!--Fresh Tilled Soil just released the curriculum as open-source, check it out!--></p>

              <p>Currently Suzanne is applying her design and development skills in creating humane experiences for clients in nonprofit and healthcare.</p>
