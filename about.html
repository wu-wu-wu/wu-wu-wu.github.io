              <!--p>I'm passionate about creating systems that help people succeed in each daily interaction big or small. My decisions are made people-first and informed by data. I aim to deliver joy and empowerment to the multitude of human experiences through digital products, art and furniture.</p-->
              <p>Suzanne grew up between the idyllic countrysides of Shandong, the crowded streets of Shanghai and now the US. The scenery changed but she's remained constantly drawing. When she got accepted into art and design school at the Rhode Island School of Design she thought her ability and love for drawing meant she can only become a lone artist with crazy hair. It was at RISD she found herself in the crazy facilities at the RISD Furniture Design Department breathing sawdust and designing everyday. Within this discipline she found her passion for creating meaningful design that made real tangible difference in other people's lives, and this outcome was way better than she could have ever predicted.</p>
              <p>Since graduating, she has worked on her craft creating marketing collaterals for various non-profits, art studios and companies like INNOVEX, Pneuhaus, and more. She also satiated her dream to work at a publishing house by developing and consuming ebooks at the MIT Press.</p>
              <p>Suzanne recently had the privilege to work with the Fresh Tilled Soil team as a part of their User Experience Apprenticeship program. The immersion included her running her first design sprint, testing and interviewing on actual users, and strategizing business goals with user goals and presenting to clients. <!--Fresh Tilled Soil just released the curriculum as open-source, check it out!--></p>
              <p>Currently Suzanne is applying her design and development skills in creating humane experiences for clients in nonprofit and healthcare.</p>
